# BSc-Physics-Project-Machine-Learning-for-Jet-Classification
My Bachelors project for 3rd Year MSci Physics

This project applies Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to the problem of jet substructure classification in high-energy physics. Using the LundNet architecture, we aim to improve binary classification performance for QCD, W, and Z boson–initiated jets.

Code is mostly taken from the ToniMlin/LundTopTagger fork. From here, we trained new models and optimized paramaters for training and test performance.

Summary of my personal contribution can be viewed on the Individual Report PDF (part of module assessment)
